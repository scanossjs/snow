# Example Project

This is an example project demonstrating the use of Snow. It has both a
[Makefile](https://github.com/mortie/snow/blob/master/exampleproject/src/Makefile)
and a
[CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/mortie/snow/blob/master/exampleproject/src/CMakeLists.txt)
for reference.

[src/main.c](https://github.com/mortie/snow/blob/master/exampleproject/src/main.c)
is the main program, which runs `snow_main()` if testing is enabled.

[src/vector.c](https://github.com/mortie/snow/blob/master/exampleproject/src/vector.c)
contains both the implementation of vectors, and the implementation's test
suite.
